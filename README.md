## General Info
This project is really important because in some Southeast Asian countries, there's no way to control the number of dogs, and many dogs end up hurt or even die from
accidents or mistreatment by people. It's hard for folks to complain about it because there aren't many places to do so.This project wants to change that. 
I'm creating a simple and easy way for people to report when something bad happens to a dog. By making it easier to speak up, we hope to help more dogs and keep them safe. Plus,
I'm making a place where people can adopt dogs, so everyone can be part of making things better for our furry friends. And also everyone could able to donate for cause.

## Technologies Used
I have used a Javascript, CSS, and HTML to achieve this. In future I would encapsulate Database to store the data.
